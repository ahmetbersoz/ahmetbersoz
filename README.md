### Hi 👋

I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher and a KTP Associate at the [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/environment-energy-resources/environmental-design). Previously, I worked at the [University of Edinburgh](https://cyberbuild.eng.ed.ac.uk/) and [METU](https://metu.edu).

My research focuses on designing and implementing robust solutions in the fields of civil engineering and computer science, with a particular focus on construction informatics, digital twins, LLMs, and reality capture technologies.
